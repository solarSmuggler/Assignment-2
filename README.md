# Assignment-2

PRINT EXERCISES
No variables appear in variable explorer

OPERATION EXERCISES
i get the same answer whether i use integer of 5 or float of 5.0 in the operation

 modulo (%) is hard for me to figure out. 
in the first example (line 31), it prints 2 because there is a remainder of 2 when you have 7 fifths
in the second example (line 32) it is easier to think of it as 0 + 5/7. 
Thinking about it like this, the answer is 5 because everything is the remainder. 

** is exponents. 3 squared (3**2) and 3 cubed (3**3) shown here.
the // operator divides, but rounds Down to the nearest integer even if the decimal value is >5

python it does follow the order of ops

VARIABLE EXERCISES
we have 8 vars in the variable explorer, one for each letterX

python has no issues with 2 variables being assigned to same value, just adds an extra variable to the explorer

redifining letterX does not affect letter2 in this case
now letterX is now redefined to hold the same value as letter1

letterX is still equal to K, because i redefined letter1 after letterX was already assigned to the previous letter1 value
if i change the original assignmnet of letter1 on line 57, then letterX will also be redeifined to that value
variable assignment in python holds to above lines, it is sequential. hope i am making sense haha

BOOLEAN
1.0 is a float, so it will always cause the print to print with decimals
1 is an integer, so it will print without decimals unless necessary as shown in line 89 which prints 0.5
differnt because they produce different outputs while the rest of the function is the same
'1' and '1.0' are not the same. these are strings now, not variables. They print as they are typed.
5 and (3+2) both return the same value, in that sense they are equivalent

LIST
i did make oddlist, it length of 5. class is list
made intlist using a for loop to include numbers 1-100

DICTIONARY
made about_me
it's type is dictionary
length is 4 because there are 4 assigned elements

ARRAY
mixing floats and integers = all numbers become floats
including strings in an array leads to all values appearing with the string apostrophes

oddarray was created with the imported numpy array module. no need for for loop this time.

logarray also made using the numpy function. logspace. this includes 16 values that increase exponentially. values start at 1 and stop at 5.
